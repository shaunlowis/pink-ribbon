# Pink ribbon charity website

- Used the starter page from [bootstrap](https://github.com/startbootstrap/startbootstrap-landing-page).
- Then modified `dist/index.html` for a themed site.
- Finally made a github pages deployment.

For sourcing the github pages, the bootstrap repo was cloned, then [this workflow](https://github.com/actions/starter-workflows/blob/main/pages/static.yml) was used.
